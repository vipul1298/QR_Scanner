## QR Scanner

### How does this work?

QR Scanner is an android application for easy redirection via a QR code. It handles redirection to media in the form of images, videos and text. To use the application:

1. Install the application on your android phone.
2. Enter the application.
3. A camera screen is visible now. Scan the QR code.
4. After the QR is scanned successfully, a link is generated. This is the link that the QR "encodes", and where redirection should lead us to.
5. Click on the link to reach the required web page.

### Tech Stack:

This android application has been developed completely using Java and the Android Studio IDE. It supports almost all versions of andriod. The app requires only the camera permission to read the QR code. Some advantages of this include:

1. Flexible and ease of use: Applications built using Andriod Studio have a quick and easy integration with multiple veriosn of the target device.

2. Easy to debug: A number of tools and extensions are available to debug, in case of error or  if the application crashes.

3. Easy to maintain: Only a small subset of the code needs to be changed to make the application compatible with other Android version, if at all.

4. Auto Focus: A special feature for low-end phones with realatively poor cameras. Auto focus automatically senses the need for changing the focal length of the camera to produce images that are sharp, which reduces error.
